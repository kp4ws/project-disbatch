# project-disbatch
A template project for building ASP.NET Core Web APIs. This project has three entities: Project, ProjectType, and Department. Each Project is assigned to a ProjectType and Department.

## Purpose
I wanted to learn ASP.NET Core Web API so I used this as a project based learning approach.  
To complete this project, I followed the course, "Build ASP.NET Core Web API - Scratch To Finish (.NET8 API)" by Sameer Saini on Udemy.
